# Android App Crash Debugging Guide

## üîß What We've Fixed

### 1. **WebView Configuration**
- Added proper WebView settings in MainActivity
- Enabled JavaScript, DOM storage, and mixed content
- Added error handling for WebView loading issues

### 2. **Network Security**
- Created `network_security_config.xml` to allow API requests
- Added `usesCleartextTraffic="true"` to AndroidManifest.xml
- Added necessary permissions for network access

### 3. **Dependencies**
- Updated Android dependencies to latest stable versions
- Added WebKit and SwipeRefreshLayout dependencies
- Added proper ProGuard rules to prevent obfuscation issues

### 4. **Error Handling**
- Enhanced JavaScript error handling in all pages
- Created fallback pages for testing
- Added comprehensive logging

## üöÄ Next Steps to Test

### Step 1: Build and Test Fallback Page
1. Open Android Studio
2. Open the `android` folder in your project
3. Build the project (Build ‚Üí Make Project)
4. Run on device/emulator
5. **Expected Result**: You should see the fallback page with "‚úÖ App Loaded Successfully!"

### Step 2: Check Logs if App Still Crashes
If the app still crashes, check the logs:

#### In Android Studio:
1. Open Logcat (View ‚Üí Tool Windows ‚Üí Logcat)
2. Filter by your app package: `com.mayna.maynasound`
3. Look for error messages starting with:
   - `MainActivity`
   - `WebView`
   - `Capacitor`
   - `FATAL EXCEPTION`

#### Using ADB (if you have it installed):
```bash
adb logcat | grep "com.mayna.maynasound"
```

### Step 3: Test Progressive Pages
If fallback.html works, test these pages in order:

1. **fallback.html** ‚úÖ (should work)
2. **test-simple.html** (tests basic functionality)
3. **launcher.html** (tests token manager)
4. **auth.html** (tests full authentication)

## üîç Common Crash Causes and Solutions

### 1. **WebView JavaScript Errors**
**Symptoms**: App crashes immediately on startup
**Solution**: Check JavaScript console in Chrome DevTools
- Connect device to computer
- Open Chrome ‚Üí chrome://inspect
- Inspect your app's WebView

### 2. **Network Security Issues**
**Symptoms**: App loads but API calls fail
**Solution**: Already fixed with network security config

### 3. **Missing Permissions**
**Symptoms**: App crashes when trying to access features
**Solution**: Already added necessary permissions

### 4. **ProGuard Obfuscation**
**Symptoms**: App crashes with "ClassNotFoundException"
**Solution**: Already disabled minification and added keep rules

### 5. **Memory Issues**
**Symptoms**: App crashes after loading large content
**Solution**: Check memory usage in Android Studio Profiler

## üõ†Ô∏è Additional Debugging Steps

### Enable WebView Debugging
The app is already configured to enable WebView debugging in debug builds.

### Test with Different Android Versions
- Test on Android 7+ (API 23+)
- Test on different screen sizes
- Test on both ARM and x86 architectures

### Check Device Compatibility
```bash
# List connected devices
adb devices

# Check device info
adb shell getprop ro.build.version.release
adb shell getprop ro.product.model
```

## üì± Testing Checklist

- [ ] App opens without crashing
- [ ] Fallback page displays correctly
- [ ] JavaScript console shows no errors
- [ ] localStorage works
- [ ] Network requests work
- [ ] Navigation between pages works
- [ ] Back button works
- [ ] App handles rotation correctly

## üö® If App Still Crashes

1. **Share the exact error message** from Logcat
2. **Share your device/emulator details**:
   - Android version
   - Device model
   - Screen resolution
3. **Try on a different device/emulator**
4. **Check if it's a specific Android version issue**

## üìû Getting Help

If you still have issues:
1. Copy the complete error log from Logcat
2. Note the exact steps that cause the crash
3. Share your device specifications
4. Try the app on a different device/emulator

## üéØ Expected Behavior

After these fixes, your app should:
1. **Open without crashing**
2. **Show the fallback page first**
3. **Allow navigation to other pages**
4. **Handle JavaScript errors gracefully**
5. **Make API calls successfully**

The fallback page is designed to be the most basic possible page that should definitely work. If this page doesn't load, there's a fundamental issue with the Android configuration that we need to address.
